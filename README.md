### Company Background
Brew Beer Company (based in Dublin): You can order beer tailored to your own liking online and you can go in store and purchase their own original beer flavours or even brew your own beer. They have some employees working in Britain and the store and website has been running for 15 years. 
 
### IT Setup:
They have two on-premise servers that carry out a combination of functions. One server is a database server used for storing data and it also acts as a web server responsible for running their online store. The second server is for e-mails and filing. They are located in a small space with good ventilation in their IT office. Local and British employees communicate and exchange files and e-mails using Microsoft Exchange in their server and Microsoft Office. They have a computer at their store till for in store transactions. 

### Recommendations:
* I recommend incorporating the cloud in their IT infrastructure.  Instead of a server for emailing and filing they can use cloud-based services such as Gmail and Microsoft Office 365. It is easier to sync multiple devices and they can log in from anywhere. They also have built in security which prevents phishing attacks and malware. Using them makes it cheaper since it needs less management. 

* Instead of a web server and putting in a lot of money upfront for service to be able to provide up to 75% of their base load, you can use the cloud where you pay for what you use. During off peak seasons they don’t waste money on the service that they don’t use and you can increase the service when there is high demand.Using a cloud provider such as AWS makes it viable since it is difficult to attack a major company so the website won’t go down easily.  

* Since the store has been running for 15 years, their legacy systems and applications is one drawback from moving the whole business to the cloud. It is difficult to migrate legacy systems and data to the cloud as it may cause service delays and data loss. Cloud APIs (application programming interface) can help free the data from the obsolete operating system and make updates easier for legacy applications. The company may choose to continue using their legacy systems because they still work and moving to the cloud may be too much of a hassle. However, they can do a hybrid of on-premise and cloud services. They can keep their data between their on-site database server and public cloud. If they want more control over their data and infrastructure it would be better to use Infrastructure as a Service. I recommend public over private cloud for this small business because the data doesn’t require high levels of security and private cloud needs more management.
